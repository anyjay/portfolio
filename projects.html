        <h3>Painting Cieling Tiles For Hackensack Hospital</h3>
        <img src="images/StarWars.png" alt="">
        <p>I was part of a summer arts program held at my local High School where we painted tiles for the Hackensack Hospital. I did that for 2 summers(as a rising freshman, then rising sophmore) with the Summer Arts Program. Additionally, I made a tile during my freshman year at BCA for a class. The image above is one of the tiles I did during the summer arts program.</p>

        <p>I helped make Mini libraries as part of the Books4All morning club my Freshman year. It was really fun going into the Makerspace and building and painting the libraries.</p>

        <h3>VocabQuiz Java</h3>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*gtY-llyEbkeoS1Sp.png" alt="">
        <p>While taking Foundations to CompSci my Sophmore year I made a code that quized you on vocab (for my literature class' trimester vocab quiz), I shared my code with the rest of the people in my class and some others that had the same teacher through replit. By the end of the year, I was able to improve the code to shuffle questions and used arrays to greatly shorten the amount of lines. It tracks your score and makes you repeat the righ answer once you get it wrong three times. I got 100 on all the quizes I studied for with my code (I could easily modify it to have different questions, Ex: I used it for Chemistry too)</p>

        <h3>Haunted Mansion</h3>
        <p>This year was probably the most I worked on Haunted Mansion. I made a 3 foot tall couldron and 12 out of 14 trees that lined the hallway that the students had to walk through.</p>
